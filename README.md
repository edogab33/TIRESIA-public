# TIRESIA-public
In this repo there are 3 files:

- TIRESIA_report.pdf: contains the complete report of the project (read this if you're interested in our methodology and results).

- TIRESIA_agglomerative.ipynb: contains the code about the Agglomerative Clustering approach.

- anon_booking_history.csv: it's the dataset we collected and used. The real students' codes have been hidden to preserve their privacy.

The notebook with all the code about our first attempt can be opened in Jupyter or Google Colab.

If you want the code about our second attempt, with our custom algorithm, please contact me at edo.gab33@gmail.com.
